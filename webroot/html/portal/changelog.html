<p><b>Welcome to taolin!</b></p>

<p>Taolin is an open source Web desktop created in the research institute <a href="http://www.fbk.eu" target="_blank">Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)</a>.

The Web desktop consists of a personal dashboard customisable by adding micro-applications called widgets. Each widget offers a different service that can be provided as a view over internal services or repositories (e.g. access to papers repository) or as a communication service (e.g. jabber web chat) or as an external resource (e.g. Google search).

Further information and demonstrative screenshots are available at Taolin website: <a href="http://taolin.fbk.eu" target="_blank">http://taolin.fbk.eu</a></p>

Please check you're using Firefox 3.0 for a better taolin experience.
